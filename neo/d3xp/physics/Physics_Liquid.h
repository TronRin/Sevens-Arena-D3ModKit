/*
===============================================================================

	Physics object for a liquid.  This class contains physics properties for a 
	given liquid.  Note: Liquid does not necessarily imply water.

	This class does very little functionally as it relies on the other physics
	classes to do the bouoyancy calculations.  It simply holds information and
	allows the other object to deal with that information however they please.

	As a side note, the difference between minSplashVelocity and 
	minWaveVelocity is that min splash is the minimum amount of velocity 
	before the liquid spawns a splash particle.  minWaveVelocity is to generate
	a wave on the surface, not a splash.  It should be lower than min splash 
	velocity.  It's the reason some things won't splash but will still cause 
	ripples in the water (especially when surfacing)
